Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository

This Repository will hold all of the queries for my Portfolio Projects.

1. COVID Dashboard 2023

This project aims to provide valuable insights into the global COVID-19 pandemic using data sourced from Our World in Data: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
The dashboard was developed through a thorough process that included data cleaning in Excel, SQL querying in BigQuery, and visualization in Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/polina.turubarova/viz/CovidDashboard2023_16927385812590/Dashboard1.

If you identify any issues or have ideas for improvements feel free to contact me.

2. Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores (guided project from DataCamp)

In this project, we used a SQL database to analyze test performance in NYC public schools. With Jupyter Notebook and SQLPostgre, we explored borough-based performance, identified unreported data, and highlighted the top ten schools. This dynamic duo enabled comprehensive insights into education trends. Additionally, please find attached a CSV file containing the data, which was generously provided by DataCamp.
