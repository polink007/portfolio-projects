1. COVID Dashboard 2023

This project aims to provide valuable insights into the global COVID-19 pandemic using data sourced from Our World in Data: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
The dashboard was developed through a thorough process that included data cleaning in Excel, SQL querying in BigQuery, and visualization in Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/polina.turubarova/viz/CovidDashboard2023_16927385812590/Dashboard1.
