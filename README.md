Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository

This Repository will hold all of the queries for my Portfolio Projects.

1. COVID Dashboard 2023

This project aims to provide valuable insights into the global COVID-19 pandemic using data sourced from Our World in Data: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
The dashboard was developed through a thorough process that included data cleaning in Excel, SQL querying in BigQuery, and visualization in Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/polina.turubarova/viz/CovidDashboard2023_16927385812590/Dashboard1.

Feel free to contact me if you identify any issues or have ideas for improvements.

2. Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores (guided project from DataCamp)

In this project, we used a SQL database to analyze test performance in NYC public schools. With Jupyter Notebook and SQLPostgre, we explored borough-based performance, identified unreported data, and highlighted the top ten schools. This dynamic duo enabled comprehensive insights into education trends. Additionally, please find attached a CSV file containing the data, which DataCamp generously provided.

3. 2022 Online Sports Sales & Customer Analysis Dashboard

For this project, first, we cleaned data in Excel to ensure the analysis in SQL was accurate and precise. Secondly, we explored the data in BigQuery using SQL to find more insights, and finally, we used Tableau to visualize our data. You can find the attached two CVS files with cleaned data, SQL queries, and here is a link to explore viz in Tableau:
